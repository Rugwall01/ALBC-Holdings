Disputes
Any disputes should be communicated directly with our support team. We strive to handle disputes efficiently through clear communication and problem resolution.

Cancellations
Subscriptions for digital products may be canceled directly via the payment provider’s platform (e.g., Stripe or ExtensionPay), which handles subscription management. Users can access their account settings on these platforms to initiate a cancellation at any time. Cancellations will prevent further billing, and users will retain access until the end of the current billing period.
